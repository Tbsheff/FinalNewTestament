        4/9/22:

        As we approach the end of the semester, I look back and try to see how much I have grown and changed since
        we started 3 months ago. I’m a different person than the one who started the semester. I have met so many
        people who have changed my life and changed how I think. They have pushed me to become better and I’m very
        grateful for that.
        One of the biggest changes to happen this semester was getting my mission call. I first submitted my papers
        about a year ago, and due to several health issues kept having to push it back. The last time I submitted my
        papers was in early December and I got my mission call mid March. Needless to say, it has been a
        rollercoaster. Nevertheless, I am so grateful for the opportunity that I have been given to serve a mission.
        I have waited my whole life for this, and waiting an extra year has only made me even more excited.
</p>

        4/2/22:

        This week I really enjoyed Elder Holland’s talk, “The First Great Commandment.” It is often hard for me to
        show my love for the Lord. I know the best way to show my love is to serve others and to devote myself to
        service. I am often not good at this, even though I want to be. Christ was the ultimate example of this. He
        never stopped serving or loving others. He is the perfect example in all things. I am trying my best to
        become better, but I still have a hard time.
        Some of my favorite parables are found in Matthew 25. I love the parable of the 10 Virgins and the parable
        of the talents. There is so much we can learn from these parables. We need to be prepared for Christ to come
        again. It is not an easy thing to prepare, and I have to try to improve every day. I want to become better.
        I try each and every day.

</p><p>

        3/26/22:

        This week I feel like we finally have started to get into the climax of Christ’s earthly ministry. The
        raising of Lazarus from the dead was His biggest miracle He had performed and is what ultimately created too
        much attention for Him. Jesus continually spoke out against the rules and traditions of the Pharisees. In
        each of the stories we read this week, Christ is showing that He is the way, the truth, and the light, not
        the traditions of the Pharisees. I need to do a better job of placing Christ at the center of my life. Right
        now, the sign I am showing God is that He is not the most important part of my life. I am spending more time
        on school, my girlfriend, and having fun. I need to prioritize God and His gospel in my life.
        This week, my girlfriend and I set some goals for our relationship that I think will really benefit each of
        us individually and as a couple. We made a goal to pray together every day and to have some sort of
        scripture study together. It is these small and simple things that make the big difference. Jesus was
        continually showing the Pharisees that they were hypocrites because they were neglecting the big things and
        focusing on things that didn’t matter nearly as much. I know I often do the same.
</p>
<p>

        3/20/22:

        This week I did some things I wasn’t very proud of and hurt people I love in the process. I have felt
        terrible for the mistakes I have made, but I am grateful to know that I can be forgiven for my sins. I may
        have done terrible things, but I can become better. When the woman taken in adultery was taken before Jesus,
        He didn’t condemn her. Instead, He rebuked her accusers and showed her love. I’m grateful for the people
        that I have hurt, for forgiving me and for helping me to become better. I know that I need to become better,
        and I am grateful for the Atonement of Jesus Christ that allows me to do so.
        This week I was watching the Chosen, the episode where Jesus is in Samaria and He talks with the woman at
        the well. Her testimony converted so many others. I want to become like this woman. Even though she had made
        many mistakes in her life, She immediately followed the Savior and shared her testimony. It is important for
        each of us to do the same. We need to move past our sins and find ways to move forward and bring others to
        Christ. I know I have so far to come. I have made so many mistakes, I have had my faith shaken, and I have
        struggled to help others come unto Him. I am trying to be better, but I have a long time to go.

</p>
<p>

        3/11/22:

        I loved reading the parables in Luke this week. One way I have come to look at the parable of the Good
        Samaritan is that Jesus is the Good Samaritan, while we are the inn keeper. Jesus will always be there to
        pick us up when we are hurt, but then He will put people into our lives who will finish the healing process
        with His help. We have to decide if there is room in our inn to accommodate someone who needs our help. At
        some point in our lives, we are all the certain man lying on the road to Jericho. And for each one of us,
        Jesus will be there to bind our wounds, comfort our souls, and bring us to our neighbors.
        I also really enjoyed studying the parable of the prodigal son. I have often been the prodigal son, rooted
        in selfish pride, thinking I am better off on my own. At other times, I have been the older son, prideful in
        a different way, thinking I am better than someone else. Obviously, that is very hypocritical. If I can do
        no better than anyone else, why should I be angry that they are being blessed. This week I have also been
        reading in Genesis for Come Follow Me. The story of the prodigal son reminds me of the story of Joseph in
        some ways. Joseph was sold into slavery and was beaten down at every turn, the dude just could not catch a
        break. Even though Joseph was righteous and always did the right thing, he was still tried and tested. The
        elder son in the parable did the right thing. He didn’t leave his father and he worked hard. Yet he was not
        the one with the fatted calf killed for him. We all need to learn how to be more like Joseph, and less like
        this elder son. We should joyfully endure trial and have faith in God that everything will work out.

        3/5/22:

        I have come to know that “with God, nothing shall be impossible.” It has taken a lot of pain and suffering
        to get where I am today, but it testifies to the power of God that I am here. I know that without God, I
        wouldn’t be here today. I have spent much of my life struggling with depression and other mental health
        issues. I spent so long feeling like I was walking by myself through the darkness. Moving past these
        struggles was not just a matter of turning to God and saying, here take it please. I struggled even when I
        pled with God to take this cup from me. But He didn’t. And I can honestly say now that I am grateful He
        didn’t. However, He did not leave me alone. I have seen so many times how the people around me have been
        inspired to reach out just when I need them. In fact, there was one time where I was had tried to commit
        suicide, but because of a prompting my dad had, he literally saved my life. I have learned time and time
        again, that God won’t take my trial away, but He will pave a path to make it through. He has opened the
        doors to lead me to greener pastures. These trials I have had have shaped me into a new creature in Christ.
        I have become so much more than I was before. I am confident and know my self worth. I am so grateful that
        God has prepared a way for me to make it through my toughest challenges. In Christ alone, my hope is found,
        and I am so grateful for it.

        2/26/22:

        I enjoyed our discussion of Matthew 13 and the Parable of the Sower or the parable of the soils. I
        especially enjoyed the comparisons drawn to Lehi’s vision. One thing that I have thought about before is
        that each one of us will inevitably end up in more than one group at some point in our lives. We may zig zag
        along the path, we may falter, we may fall, but what really matters is our trajectory and our slope. At
        certain points during my life, I have felt like I am wandering through the mists of darkness. Other times, I
        feel like I have tasted of the fruit and am holding fast to the rod of iron. In my opinion, the true goal
        should be to continually progress and to point ourselves in the right direction.
        The other thing I enjoyed about class this week was our discussion on horizontal teaching and vertical
        teaching. Something really important to know when teaching any sort of lesson is that the Spirit is the true
        teacher. The job of the teacher is to facilitate discussions and bring the spirit into meetings. I have
        liked the Church’s emphasis on this lately. They have restructured how lessons are taught and I have really
        enjoyed it. The best way to teach a lesson is to invite the members of the class to share their thoughts.
        When everyone participates, everyone is edified. I have found that the most successful lessons I have taught
        are the ones where I don’t lecture but instead ask questions.
        </p>
<p>
        2/19/22:

        I love that this week we got to learn more about Brother Smith and listen to his stories. I was talking with
        my Grandparents this week about missionary work. I have been working to go on a mission for a year and a
        half now, but because of medical reasons, things keep getting delayed. As I talked with them, my grandpa
        shared a few stories from his life about the importance of being a missionary to the people in your ward and
        being a friend to them. It is just as important to keep people active and reactivate them as it is to
        baptize new converts. This was a good reminder for me that there is so much I can do even if I don’t get the
        opportunity I want to serve as a proselyting missionary.
        This week during my additional reading for class I read the lecture by Robert Millet about making our
        calling and election sure. I really enjoyed his thoughts on this subject and appreciated that he reminded us
        that we are doing better than we think. I had read about having our calling and election made sure, but I
        never understood what it meant. I now understand that it means we gain a knowledge in this life that we will
        receive exaltation in the next life. It is not something we should necessarily strive for, we shouldn’t
        focus on knowing whether we are going to make it. But by consistently doing the good things we are supposed
        to do, we can receive that assurance.

        2/11/22:

        I find it fascinating how structured and well organized Matthew is. He places everything in a specific order
        for a reason. There is always a reason for every verse and the order of that verse. For instance, the
        grouping of all the miracles into a few chapters helps to highlight many of the similarities between His
        miracles. There are many common themes that are more easily recognizable when the parables are grouped
        together. Furthermore, Matthew shows that Jesus did miracles for everyone. By grouping the miracles
        together, He is also showing the differences between the people that He heals or blesses. From poor Jews to
        wealthy Romans, Jesus does not discriminate, and that is made obvious by Matthew’s placement of the
        miracles. We are able to see that Jesus loves everyone and is a Savior for the world, not just the Jews or
        just the righteous.
        Another thing that I found interesting is that Jesus is not concerned with being ritually unclean like the
        Pharisees were. He actively sought out those who were unclean, because those were the ones who needed Him
        the most. Instead of avoiding those who were unclean, He cleansed them, showing love to all that He met.
        Christ never turned away someone who sincerely wanted to follow Him and showed faith in His teachings. This
        is a lesson I need to learn. We should not turn away from those who do not do what we think is right. We
        need to love them and bring them back into the fold.
</p><p>
        2/1/22:

        The first few chapters of Matthew are some of my favorite in the New Testament. Reading about Jesus being
        tempted in the wilderness is what gave me a greater appreciation for the Joseph Smith Translation.
        Furthermore, the Sermon on the Mount is one of the greatest sermons in all of scripture, if not THE
        greatest. One thing that struck me as I read the Sermon on The Mount this time was chapter 5 verse 23. If we
        go before God to sacrifice or to tell God how much we love Him, and remember that we have harmed someone
        else, we need to be reconciled as soon as possible. It is more important for us to leave our worship of God
        and to heal whatever wounds we have with our brother. That is the greatest way to worship God.
        One of the overarching themes of the Sermon on the Mount is that we must not be hypocrites. That is
        something that I really struggle with. It is easy for me to teach gospel principles to others; however, it
        is much harder for me to live them myself. I struggle with judging others, even though I have so far to go
        myself. I find it hard to see the good in others and tend to just focus on their faults. I do recognize that
        this is not what I should be doing, and I am trying to get better. It is my duty to love my neighbor, no
        matter what mistakes have been made.
</p>

        1/21/22:

        I actually enjoyed watching the dramatization and performance of the gospel of Mark. It was funny, but also
        didn’t deviate from the scriptural account. This is closer to how the scriptures originally were
        distributed. It’s not something I had really thought about before. Realizing that there have been so many
        people throughout the course of history without access to written scriptural records makes me incredibly
        grateful for the scriptures that we have. We have more scripture now that any other time on earth, and it is
        all in the palm of my hand. I want to try and become better at using and studying these scriptures.
        The gospel of Mark is not the gospel I would say is my favorite or the one that I go to first. But it is
        very important. It is easy to skip past it, saying oh its short and its exactly the same as Matthew and
        Luke. But it is important to take the time to study Mark. There may not be as many unique aspects of Mark
        relative to the rest of the gospels, but the content that is unique is very important. The Messianic Secret
        is the best example of this. It helps us get a different portrait of Jesus than the other gospel authors
        give us. I had known for sometime about the Messianic secret but I never realized how Jesus allowed the
        Gentiles to share about Him. I found that interesting and good evidence of why Jesus didn’t want the Jews to
        share what He had done.
</p>
<p>
        1/5/22:

        This week has been really good background for studying the New Testament. It is important to understand the
        foundations before diving into the details. I have also enjoyed that we are learning HOW to study and not
        just what we should study. It is important that we are understanding what the author wanted to convey and
        how they are conveying that message. Furthermore, we need to understand how it can apply to us today and
        what God wants us to learn from it. It is much easier to understand the scriptures if we have the
        background.
        I know how important it is to understand the New Testament. If I want to be a good missionary and share the
        gospel with others, I need to make sure I understand the life of Christ and the scriptures that other people
        are most familiar with. Furthermore, the gospels give us a glimpse of the life of Jesus Christ. By studying
        the life of Christ, we are studying the perfect example of everything. IF we can learn to teach, serve and
        love as Christ did, the world would be a much better place. I enjoyed seeing some of the similarities
        between the New Testament and the Book of Mormon. It gave me a better perspective of how they are both books
        of scripture that complement each other. It is not enough to only study one book of scripture. Our lifelong
        task is to study all of the scriptures. We have a responsibility to learn as much of the gospel as we can.
